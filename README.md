# NN-Invariant-Elements

Research on identifying  some  of  the  invariant  elements  of  Neural  Networks  to geometric transformations using image data. For the purposes of this research, I have used 3 widely used datasets, but only the work on the CIFAR-10 dataset has been uploaded as the approach on the other datasets is very similar. 

7 different models have been used, specifically;
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- (Standard) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- CNN with max pooling layers
- CNN with average pooling layers
- CNN with dropout layers (0.3)
- CNN with a global pooling layer
- CNN with a global average pooling layer
